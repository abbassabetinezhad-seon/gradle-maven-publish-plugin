This product includes software developed by Niklas Baudy
(https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-maven-publish-plugin)

This is a modified version that handles Sonatype service shutdown gracefully.
The original software is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Modifications:
- Fixed error handling in SonatypeRepositoryBuildService.kt to prevent build failures during service shutdown
- Added proper exception handling for MissingValueException and other runtime exceptions
- Improved logging to provide better visibility into service shutdown issues
- Published under the io.seon.gradle namespace to distinguish from the original plugin
